The top user insights were then crafted into Idea Briefs to inspire and focus idea generation.", "global_activity_url": "https://methodry.com/design-training/", "earn_this_badge_url": null, "enable_earn_this_badge": false, "enable_detail_attribute_visibility": true, "level": "Intermediate", "name": "Problem Definition", "vanity_slug": "problem-definition", "time_to_earn": "Days", "type_category": "Learning", "show_badge_lmi": false, "show_skill_tag_links": true, "translatable": false, "image": {"id": "f6147bff-8868-4dea-ac28-edc253cedc7a", "url": "https://images.credly.com/images/f6147bff-8868-4dea-ac28-edc253cedc7a/image.png"}, "image_url": "https://images.credly.com/images/f6147bff-8868-4dea-ac28-edc253cedc7a/image.png", "url": "https://www.credly.com/org/methodry/badge/problem-definition", "issuer": {"summary": "issued by Methodry", "entities": [{"label": "Issued by", "primary": true, "entity": {"type": "Organization", "id": "1b090ef6-c55c-4529-88ce-5d0e0da5d89a", "name": "Methodry", "url": "https://www.credly.com/api/v1/organizations/1b090ef6-c55c-4529-88ce-5d0e0da5d89a", "vanity_url": "https://www.credly.com/org/methodry", "internationalize_badge_templates": false, "share_to_ziprecruiter": true, "verified": false}}]}, "alignments": [], "badge_template_activities": [{"id": "5230ec21-e238-46dc-8efa-28f169fabdb3", "activity_type": "Course", "required_badge_template_id": null, "title": "Completed Methodry's Problem Definition Course.", "url": null}], "endorsements": [], "skills": [{"id": "e187dc86-0be9-4b6a-bab8-f967c05fb7c8", "name": "Crafting Idea Briefs", "vanity_slug": "crafting-idea-briefs"}, {"id": "1ce2df40-2d3d-4f82-8e1b-2263733f5be2", "name": "Empathy and Insight Behaviours", "vanity_slug": "empathy-and-insight-behaviours"}, {"id": "b6e866bd-a23c-4e8c-817e-82dc5a3e461d", "name": "Empathy Map", "vanity_slug": "empathy-map"}, {"id": "f9223146-27f4-4772-bafa-94b97da393b3", "name": "Insight Generation", "vanity_slug": "insight-generation"}, {"id": "791df33b-a5ec-471b-9016-e8601e3980b0", "name": "Problem Definition", "vanity_slug": "problem-definition"}, {"id": "2f7ed34b-1082-4ec9-9666-e502749aa172", "name": "Synthesis", "vanity_slug": "synthesis"}, {"id": "ff04a366-7f16-4bca-9f44-417dca3d95f2", "name": "User Empathy", "vanity_slug": "user-empathy"}, {"id": "45def466-1509-450a-87fb-a54264b4d2ea", "name": "User Research", "vanity_slug": "user-research"}]}, "44863415-eb42-4cb9-a7b7-c58933147e59": {"id": "44863415-eb42-4cb9-a7b7-c58933147e59", "cost": "Paid", "description": "Earners of this badge have been introduced to the key methods and skills for applying a human-centred, creative and experimentation driven approach to innovation and problem solving.
